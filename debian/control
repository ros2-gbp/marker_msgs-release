Description: The marker_msgs package contains messages usable to setup a marker/fiducial system.
 The package distinguishes between two types of messages. First messages to describe the properties of a marker/fiducial detection system and the detected markers. Secondly messages used to represent a map of markers/features with covariances as it would be produced by a SLAM system or published by a map server for self-localization.
